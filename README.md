# Parallel Subgraph Listing
My bachelor thesis.
Using the graphlab/turi framework to achieve subgraph listing.
This project is done in the scenario of RDF data query processing - A SPARQL query is transformed into a tree-style graph and is matched on the orinigal RDF graph data using parallel matching filters.
It decreases the query variance especially in complex queries.
